# scdd-2016-app
This project is for easing out the registration process for users for the startups club DemoDay-2016.The user can register from the mobile handset and all the information regarding the events can be viewed in the app.This is a dynamic application which means all the data is stored in the server and the app is kept in sync with the server, which helps the admin to easily modify any data on the fly and the same gets reflected to all the users.
